### Carousel Component (Slider.tsx) - Fixed Image Display and Text Readability Issues

**Issue**: Project carousels had cut-off images and unreadable text against dark background.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Height conflict: Container had `aspect-video` but inner image div had fixed `h-64` causing images to be cropped
2. Text readability: Inconsistent prose styling - left side used default colors, right side had `text-white`
3. Navigation dots: Used `bg-black` and `bg-gray-300` which weren't visible on dark background

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Image Display**:
   - Removed fixed `h-64` height from image container
   - Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` to show full images without cropping
   - Added `bg-gray-900` background to slider container for better contrast
   - Added `priority` loading for first slide performance

2. **Text Readability**:
   - Applied `prose-invert` and `text-gray-300` to both content sections
   - Ensured consistent readable text styling across dark background

3. **Navigation Improvements**:
   - Changed active dot from `bg-black` to `bg-white`
   - Changed inactive dots from `bg-gray-300` to `bg-gray-500` with hover state
   - Enhanced navigation button styling and contrast
   - Increased spacing between carousel and content sections

4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Made project titles consistently white
   - Improved button padding and visual feedback
   - Better spacing and visual hierarchy

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Slider.tsx` - Complete carousel component overhaul

**Status**: âœ… Fixed - Images now display fully without cropping, text is readable on dark background, navigation is clearly visible.
